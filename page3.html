		<h2>Why I Want To Be A Part Of Friars</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
		Something that I have started taking more seriously is my spare time. I know that may sound weird but let me elaborate. This dreading feeling of inevitably graduating has caused me to try and live more in the moment and take advantage of my time left. It’s this desire to do stuff that I normally wouldn’t do to give me new experiences. That means meeting new people, going to events or shows that I wouldn’t normally go to, or learning something new (like coding a website!). I cannot think of any organization that gives me a better chance to participate in these kinds of activities, other than Friars. At the smoker, one of the current members asked me what happened in this past year that changed my life the most. I replied that I had read a book that was all about mindfulness. The reason I am mentioning this is because, when I read the official Friar’s creed, it sounded as if it came straight out of the book. I have been making an effort to be more conscience in my approach to life. According to the book, the best way to reach the goal of living a fulfilling life can be summarized by the following excerpt from the creed; “the only good reason for your existence is not what you are going to get out of life, but what you are going to give to life”. I plan on giving all that I can give to my peers and my university in my final days as a Quaker.
