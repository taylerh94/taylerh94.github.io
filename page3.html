		<h2>Why I Want To Be A Part Of Friars</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
		When I first heard I had a chance to join Friars, I’ll be honest I had no clue what this organization exactly was. So I decided to look at the website as per the suggestion of the invitation. All the prestigious alumni that this organization has produced astounded me. But what really caught my eye was this part of the creed; “The only good reason for your existence is not what you are going to get out of life, but what you are going to give to life.” This part of the creed has been a value that I instilled into my life ever since I was in high school. But I did not understand what this truly means. It’s not just limited to volunteering and donating to charities as what my younger self would think. It meant being a kind soul, a friendly face, someone who is encouraging and understanding to everyone. I failed to realize that this did not apply only to people who were less fortunate to me, but to my equals as well. As a competitor, my natural instinct is to view my peers as rivals. However, as I’ve come to realize, they are just as deserving to receive my compassion and consideration as any other person. This organization appears to have a unique reach throughout this campus that would allow me to be a part of something bigger than myself. I want to be a part of a group that cares and supports their fellow classmates to the fullest extent.  Friars is one of the few organizations at this school that I feel is actually making a real difference around campus by showing up and supporting what students are actually passionate about.
